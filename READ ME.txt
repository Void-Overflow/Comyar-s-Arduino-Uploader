    Weclome to Comyar's Arduino Uploader! In this application, you can upload and compile code to your Arduino, view the Serial Monitor, and do this all from one app. 
  This application was originally intended to update the clock for the Comyar's Bike Tool, but it can also be used generally.
  
  In order to use this application, you must have the .net framework installed on your computer. To install, and for more information abou .tnet, please visit 
  https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download.
  
    In order to set this up, there are a couple installation methods you must use. Firstly, unzip the file. Secondly, navigate to this path within the unzipped folder -
avr-g++/arduino-cli/bin . Once in that directory, there should be a file called arduino-cli.rar. Unzip that using any unzipping software. I recommend to use WinRar,
which can be downloaded @https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0.
